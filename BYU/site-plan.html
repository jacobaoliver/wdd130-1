      <h3>Greatest Players</h3>
      <p>
        BYU is known for being one of the largest producers of NFL Superstars.
        On this page, there will be listed every NFL who played NCAA Football at BYU.
        This list is based on each of these players' NFL careers, not college.
        There is a short description of the player and his NFL career.
        The header of each player is a link to their "sports-reference" page. 
        Also, some of these players are destined to rise the list because of their 
        young age and currently being in the NFL (Puka Nacua, Taysom Hill, Jamaal Williams, Zach Wilson, etc.).
        The team name next to each player was the organization who drafted the him.
