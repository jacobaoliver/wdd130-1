    <h3>The Latest of This Season</h3>
    <p>The BYU Cougars are having a stellar 2024 college football season, coming tantalizingly close to an undefeated record with an impressive 10-2 finish. Their journey to this point has been marked by electrifying performances, including dominant blowout victories and thrilling nailbiters that kept fans on the edge of their seats. This season has showcased their resilience, depth, and ability to rise to challenges, solidifying their position as a top-tier team.

      As the postseason approaches, the Cougars eagerly await an official bowl invitation. Current projections from ESPN, CBS, Action Network, and 247Sports suggest that BYU is on track to appear in the prestigious Alamo Bowl, where they are expected to face the Colorado Buffaloes on December 28 in San Antonio, Texas. A matchup against Colorado, led by Coach Deion Sanders, would undoubtedly be a high-profile clash, drawing significant attention from fans and analysts alike. This game promises to be an exciting capstone to an extraordinary season for BYU.</p>
