    <h1>The Awesome Seattle Mariners!</h1>
    <button class="accordion">Team History</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The Seattle Mariners, established in 1977, are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in Seattle,
            Washington. They are part of the American League (AL) West Division and play their home games at T-Mobile
            Park. Despite being one of the newer franchises in MLB, the Mariners have built a rich history of memorable
            players and moments. The team’s first playoff appearance came in 1995, a season that remains iconic in
            Mariners lore due to Edgar Martinez’s legendary "Double" that secured a dramatic postseason victory.</p>

        <p>Over the years, the Mariners have been home to several baseball legends. Ken Griffey Jr., one of the most
            celebrated players in MLB history, dazzled fans with his power and grace in center field. Ichiro Suzuki
            brought a unique blend of hitting and fielding that earned him numerous accolades, including the AL MVP and
            Rookie of the Year in 2001. The team also holds the MLB record for most wins in a single season, with an
            astonishing 116 victories in 2001, a season that showcased their dominance.</p>
